### Neural Network Architecture
```python
class ManualNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_sizes, output_size, learning_rate, activation):
        # Manual weight initialization with Xavier method
        # No tensorflow, no sklearn - pure numpy implementation
        
    def forward(self, X):
        # Manual forward propagation through all layers
        # Custom activation functions: tanh, sigmoid, relu
        
    def backward(self, X, y, activations, z_values):
        # Manual backpropagation with gradient descent
        # Custom MSE loss calculation and weight updates
```

### Fitness Evaluation
```python
def _manual_fitness_evaluation(self, chromosome):
    # 1. Create neural network with chromosome parameters
    # 2. Train using manual backpropagation (no model.fit())
    # 3. Evaluate on validation set manually
    # 4. Calculate fitness = -MSE - complexity_penalty
    # 5. Return fitness score (higher = better)
```

### Genetic Operations
```python
def _tournament_selection():    # Select best from random tournament
def _crossover():              # Exchange hyperparameters between parents
def _mutate():                 # Random parameter modification
def run_evolution():           # Complete GA evolution loop
```
