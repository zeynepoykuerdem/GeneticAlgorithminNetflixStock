# GeneticAlgorithminNetflixStockPricePrediction using Time Series Forecasting Approach
The Objective of this project to obtain better generation of solutions for time series forecasting using
generic algorithm. The model aims to predict the next dayâ€™s adjusted close of price of Netflix stock .

-Loss value has not been calculated correctly, because I calculated the loss value arbitrarily and it calculates not inidivdually
